                        The first Doctoral Workshop (SySDW'23) will provide a forum for PhD students to present their work and receive constructive feedback from experts in the field, as well as from peers. The workshop will also offer a platform for senior graduate students to showcase their research to other community members as a way to help their job search. Technical presentations will be augmented with keynotes and panels offering general advice and discussions for students in all stages of their career. SySDW'23 will also offer the opportunity for mentoring.

                        <strong>
                            The idea is to give graduate students a chance to talk one-on-one (or, in some cases, one-on-two) about their research with outstanding researchers beyond those available at the students' universities.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Workshop Format</h2>
                    <p>
                        The goal of the workshop is to provide feedback and advice to PhD students in all stages of their career both on technical aspects of their research as well as career development. We expect a range of participants such as the presenters' peers, as well as senior researchers who will attend to share their expertise and provide constructive feedback. The idea is to create opportunities for students to meet with peers outside of their home institution, to get technical feedback as well as career advice from senior researchers in their field, to find out about internship and job opportunities, and to articulate their own work in a public, non-threatening forum. We encourage the participants to stay for the duration of the SOSP main conference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will accept two types of submissions:
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Work-in-progress abstract:</b> This is intended for early PhD students who have selected a clear research topic. The students will submit a 2-page abstract (instructions below) followed by a research work presentation during the workshop.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Research statement:</b> This is intended for senior PhD students who plan to be on the job market in the next 1-2 years. Students will submit a 3-page description of past and future research. The students will then present their research plan in the form an elevator pitch presentation during the workshop.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                    <p>
                        Research topics of interest cover computing systems in the broadest sense, including work on formal foundations, as well as the design, implementation and evaluation of real systems. More specifically, research topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
